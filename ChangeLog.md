## [2.4.4] - 2026-06-24
### Changed
- Reworked README around the Homebridge Device Lab direction.
- Removed the LightSensor-specific transform hook; use JSONata expressions for value fixes such as mapping `0` lux to `0.0001`.
- Removed Discord webhook support from runtime code and Homebridge UI schema.
- Updated dependency lockfile and direct dependency ranges; npm audit reports 0 vulnerabilities.

## [2.4.3] - in progress
- Dependencies update

## [2.4.2] 
- Added optional `transform` function to the sensor type definition.
- Currently used **only for `LightSensor`**.  
  
### 🛠️ How it works
  
- For `LightSensor`, the sensor definition includes a `transform` function.
- When a value is read for `LightSensor`, the code checks:
  - if the sensor has a `transform` function,
  - if yes, it passes the raw value into `transform(...)`,
  - the returned value is then sent to HomeKit.
- In practice: for `LightSensor`, `0` is transformed to `0.0001` before updating the characteristic.


## [2.4.0] - in progress
### ✅ New Features
- Battery monitoring adding to all sensors types

### 🛠️ Improvements
- Updated `package.json`, `build.yml` 

## [2.3.0] - 2025-11-25
### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Dropped support for Node.js v18  
- Minimum required Node.js version is now **v20.18**
- config.schema.json converted to Array do to UI issues in homebridge-config-ui-x 5.9 amd newer. There is still tabarray version available,
rename file config.schema.json.tabarray BUT use it only with up to homebridge-config-ui-x 5.8 version

### ✅ New Features
- Added support for Node.js v24  
- Battery monitoring added to Temperature/Humidity accessory  
- Introduced accessory-only Battery service

### 🛠️ Improvements
- Updated `package.json` with fixes and adjustments  
- Enhanced `config.schema.json` structure


## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- ✅ Support for self-signed HTTPS certificates via new `HttpsAgentManager` class.
- ✅ UI configuration option `ignoreHttpsCertErrors` to skip certificate validation when needed.
- ✅ UI field `trustedCert` to provide inline PEM certificate content directly in config.
- ✅ Centralized HTTPS agent logic with caching to avoid redundant instantiation.
- ✅ Integrated HTTPS agent support across all polling methods (sensor, switch, outlet, lightbulb).

### Changed
- 🔄 Refactored all polling classes to use shared `HttpsAgentManager` for secure and consistent HTTPS handling.
- 🔄 Improved error logging for Axios HTTPS failures, including certificate-related issues.

### Fixed
- 🛠 Prevented duplicate HTTP requests in shared polling scenarios.
- 🛠 Ensured HTTPS agent is only instantiated when required, with runtime checks for lean operation.
